// PSEUDOCODE FOR THE APP

// 1. Fetch data from google sheets (done, data lives in FetchData.jsx)

// 2A. Segment data and display in three different views: Leaderboard, StatsCast, Queens
//      each view should probably have their own component
// 2B. Data is currently in an array of objects. I will need to pull the keys to display as headings in addition to the values for the table.

// 3. Each view is a "table" of the data, formatted how Jay wants. Probably do flexbox for that

// 4. Create a layout wrapper for the header & footer. Header is just the logo (links back to wix page) and white bar, footer are three links to each of the views
